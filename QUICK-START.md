# Quick Start: Push to GitHub and Deploy

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

**You must push your project to GitHub FIRST before you can deploy it to your server.**

## Step 1: Push Your Project to GitHub Right Now

### Option A: Create New Repository on GitHub Website
1. Go to https://github.com and click "New repository"
2. Name it: `nurmakon-hotel`
3. Make it Public (easier) or Private (your choice)
4. **DON'T** check any initialization options
5. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)
```bash
gh repo create nurmakon-hotel --public
```

## Step 2: Push Your Files

In your project folder, run these commands:

```bash
# Check if git is already initialized
git status

# If not initialized, run:
git init

# Add all your files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Hotel booking app with Docker deployment ready"

# Add your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nurmakon-hotel.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Your Files Are Now Ready

After pushing, your GitHub repository will contain:
- ✅ All your hotel booking app code
- ✅ Dockerfile (optimized for production)
- ✅ docker-compose.yml (with health checks)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- ✅ Environment configuration (.env.example)
- ✅ Deployment script (deploy.sh)
- ✅ Complete documentation (DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)

## Step 4: Now You Can Continue

**After Step 3 is complete**, continue with the full deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`

The process will be:
1. ✅ **Push to GitHub (you're doing this now)**
2. Set up DockerHub account
3. Configure GitHub secrets
4. Create Hetzner server
5. Clone from GitHub to server ← **This is where you were stuck**
6. Deploy and enjoy!

**Important**: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username in the git commands above.

**Repository URL Format**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nurmakon-hotel`
